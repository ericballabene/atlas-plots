Welcome to atlasplots!
=======================

**atlasplots** is a suite of utility functions and style settings for making pretty plots with `PyROOT <https://root.cern.ch/pyroot>`_ for the `ATLAS Experiment <https://atlas.cern/>`_ at `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_.

Writing code to produce high energy physics plots in classic C++ ROOT is notoriously cumbersome and slow.
PyROOT and **atlasplots** help make things a little easier.
