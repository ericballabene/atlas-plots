Getting Started

Before You Begin
----------------

If you can, use Python 3. Have a look at `Picking a Python Interpreter <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/which-python/>`_ on Kenneth Reitz's `Guide to Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/>`_ for a few reasons why.

Also have a look at the chapter on `Properly Installing Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_ for recommendations on how to install your Python interpreter.

If you're using a Mac, you can install Python with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install python3

Homebrew also installs ``pip3`` for you, which is an alias pointing to ``pip`` in your Homebrew'd version of Python 3.

.. note::

    You may encounter issues with file permissions when installing software because Homebrew needs write access to ``/usr/local/``.
    Since ``brew install`` will not work with root privileges (unless ``brew`` itself is owned by root), you can change the ownership of the contents of ``/usr/local/``, or wherever Homebrew installs software, with,

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*

    Proceed with caution, however, if you have other non-Homebrew'd software here.

Installing ROOT
---------------

`ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/>`_ is a scientific software framework developed at CERN for data analysis in high energy physics.
The easiest way to install ROOT if you're using a Mac is also with Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install root --with-python3 --without-python

This compiles ROOT from source which can take upwards of 90 minutes, but at the advantage of giving you access to the ROOT libraries from Python 3.
``brew install root`` on the other hand installs a pre-compiled version of ROOT, which by default only supports Python 2.

If you don't like using Homebrew, you can always download ROOT from https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root and install it manually.
Or if you're feeling really adventurous, you can clone the `ROOT GitHub repository <https://github.com/root-project/root>`_ and install it from source.

.. note::

    Because ROOT depends on several installation-dependent environment variables to function properly, you should add the following commands to your shell initialization script (.bashrc/.profile/etc.), or call them directly before using ROOT.

    For bash users:
        ``. /usr/local/bin/thisroot.sh``
    For zsh users:
        ``pushd /usr/local >/dev/null; . bin/thisroot.sh; popd >/dev/null``
    For csh/tcsh users:
        ``source /usr/local/bin/thisroot.csh``

PyROOT
------

`PyROOT <https://root.cern.ch/pyroot>`_ is a Python extension module that allows the user to interact with any ROOT class from the Python interpreter. 
Using PyROOT is super easy.
As an example, consider opening a TBrowser:

>>> import ROOT
>>> br = ROOT.TBrowser()

Or if you prefer, you can import ROOT classes directly:

>>> from ROOT import TBrowser
>>> br = TBrowser()

.. note::

    As a shortcut, set an alias to ``python -i -c "import ROOT"`` to open a Python shell with ROOT ready to go. 

To illustrate the power and simplicity of PyROOT, consider opening a ROOT file ``data_file.root`` containing a TTree called ``data_tree``:

>>> import ROOT
>>> file = ROOT.TFile.Open("data_file.root")
>>> tree = file.data_tree
>>> tree.Print()
******************************************************************************
*Tree    :data_tree : Test ROOT tree                                         *
*Entries :     3524 : Total =         2104055 bytes  File  Size =     196761 *
*        :          : Tree compression factor =  10.76                       *
******************************************************************************
*Br    0 :eta       : eta/D                                                  *
*Entries :     3524 : Total  Size=     542582 bytes  File Size  =      49459 *
*Baskets :       18 : Basket Size=      32000 bytes  Compression=  10.96     *
*............................................................................*
*Br    1 :phi       : phi/D                                                  *
*Entries :     3524 : Total  Size=     542582 bytes  File Size  =      49459 *
*Baskets :       18 : Basket Size=      32000 bytes  Compression=  10.96     *
*............................................................................*
...

As a complete example, suppose you want to print all the values in the ``eta`` branch:

.. code-block:: python

    import ROOT

    file = ROOT.TFile.Open("data_file.root")
    tree = file.data_tree
    
    for entry in tree:
        print(entry.eta)

Compare this to the equivalent C++ ROOT macro:

.. code-block:: c++

    {
        TFile* file = TFile::Open("data_file.root");

        TTreeReader data_reader("data_tree", file);
        TTreeReaderValue<double> eta(data_reader, "eta");

        while (data_reader.Next()) {
            std::cout << *eta << std::endl;
        }
    }

Installing atlasplots
---------------------

**atlasplots** isn't in PyPI (yet) so for now it's best to clone the source and install as editable:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:joeycarter/atlas-plots.git
    $ cd atlas-plots
    $ pip install -e .

To uninstall:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip uninstall atlasplots

Installing on lxplus
--------------------

.. note::

    Fellow ATLAS members: follow these instructions to set up **atlasplots** on ``lxplus``.
    Other CERN folk, you may have to fill in some of the gaps to set up the latest versions of ROOT and Python.

If you're like me and want to use **atlasplots** on ``lxplus`` (to avoid copying over potentially large ROOT files to your local machine), there are a few extra steps involved to install it.
As of writing these docs, the default version of ROOT installed on ``lxplus`` is 5.34/36 and the default version of Python is 2.6.6 (*sigh*...).
First things first, let's get proper, recent releases of these two applications:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ setupATLAS
    $ lsetup root

.. note::

    Careful here: setting up ROOT in this way might interfere with certain environment and ``PATH`` variables if you have an ``Athena`` release set up in your current shell.

Now we have at least ROOT 6.10/04 and Python 2.7.13 (it's no Python 3, but it'll do).
With this sparkling new software ready to go, you will likely run into an issue if you start trying to install packages with ``pip``: installing packages will normally work, but you can't import them.
This is because while you can set up different versions of Python on ``lxplus``, there is only the default system ``pip`` available.
To get around this, you can install the latest version of ``pip`` yourself:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py && python get-pip.py --user

This installs ``pip`` to ``~/.local/bin/`` (you can get rid of ``get-pip.py`` afterwards).
Now to use ``pip``, you can set the following alias:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ alias pip="python ~/.local/bin/pip"

Then to install a package,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install <package> --user

The ``--user`` flag tells ``pip`` to install packages to ``~/.local/lib/`` (which is necessary since you don't have ``sudo`` privileges on ``lxplus``).
Finally, at long last, you can install **atlasplots**:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:joeycarter/atlas-plots.git
    $ cd atlas-plots
    $ pip install -e . --user

Basic Usage
-----------

Import the **atlasplots** package:

>>> import atlasplots

Set the ATLAS Style for plotting:

>>> from atlasplots import atlas_style as astyle
>>> astyle.SetAtlasStyle()

Add the "*ATLAS* Internal" label to a plot:

>>> from atlasplots import atlas_style as astyle
>>> astyle.ATLASLabel(0.2, 0.87, "Internal")

For a collection of complete examples, see the :ref:`examples` section.
